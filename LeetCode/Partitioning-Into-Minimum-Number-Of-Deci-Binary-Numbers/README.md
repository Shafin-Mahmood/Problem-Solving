# Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers

Can you solve this real interview question? Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers - A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.

Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

Example 1:


Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32


Example 2:


Input: n = "82734"
Output: 8


Example 3:


Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
Output: 9
